# Applications of Multiple Mediation Analysis in Perinatal Epidemiology

1) The folder *Causal intermediate confounders and the perinatal crossover paradox* contains the R scripts used to implement interventional effects for a single mediator with exposure-induced confounders (VanderWeele et al., 2014), and for multiple mediators (Vansteelandt and Daniel, 2017), as well as the developed bias formulas for unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding, in the paper:

2) The folder *Competing obstetrical interventions using interventional effects* contains the R scripts used to implement interventional effects for multiple mediators (Vansteelandt and Daniel, 2017) in the paper:

3) The folder *Sequential mediators using natural effects* contains the R scripts used to implement natural effect models for multiple mediators (Steen et al., 2017) in the paper:
